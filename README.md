# README: Macro-Economic Metrics Analysis
## Summary
This project is a series of scripts designed to track and analyze recession-related macroeconomic metrics. The initial focus is on visualizing key indicators, such as the yield curve and recession periods, using data from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data). The goal is to enhance these scripts over time, incorporating smarter analytical methods to compare current conditions with past economic downturns and ultimately deploying this analysis on a website.

Requirements
- Python Libraries:
    pandas
    pandas_datareader
    matplotlib
- Data Source: The scripts fetch data from FRED, so an internet connection is required for data retrieval.


## Future Improvements
1. Advanced Analysis:
- Add functionality to compare current metrics to previous recessions using statistical and machine learning methods.
- Generate insights, such as the average yield curve inversion period before a recession.

2. Additional Metrics:
- Integrate more economic indicators, such as unemployment rates, GDP growth, inflation, and consumer sentiment.

3. Interactive Website:
- Deploy the analysis on a website for real-time updates and accessibility.
- Use interactive tools, such as sliders and dropdowns, to allow users to customize date ranges and metrics.

4. Automated Reporting:
- Generate automated summaries and reports for key findings, highlighting significant deviations from historical patterns.
