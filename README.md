# README: Macro-Economic Metrics Analysis
## Summary
This project is aimed to bring key macroecoonomic trends and indicators to the masses in a free and open source way. Many economic charts are available via paid services and are rarely in one place, this initiative aims to brake down these walls and bring the metrics that matter to all interested indiviuals in real time. 


Requirements
- Python Libraries:
    pandas, pandas_datareader, matplotlib
- Data Source: The scripts fetch data from FRED, so an internet connection is required for data retrieval.

## Example Chart
![10YearMinus2Year](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35f275e0-5385-4e5f-b6db-ae12c08757a3)

## Script Structure
1. Summary Section highlighting the reason for the chart, where the data comes from, and how often it gets published.
2. Script gathering and plotting data onto a chart
3. Relevant tables published to the terminal for real time data.

## Future Improvements
1. Advanced Analysis:
- Add functionality to compare current metrics to previous recessions using statistical and machine learning methods.
- Generate insights, such as the average yield curve inversion period before a recession.

2. Additional Metrics:
- Integrate many more economic indicators, such as unemployment rates, GDP growth, inflation, and consumer sentiment.

3. Interactive Website:
- Deploy the analysis on a website for real-time updates and accessibility.
- Use interactive tools, such as sliders and dropdowns, to allow users to customize date ranges and metrics.

4. Automated Reporting:
- Generate automated summaries and reports for key findings, highlighting significant deviations from historical patterns.
